Is cycling talent genetic or learned? 

In the hope of finding an answer we set off on the 55 miles to Cambridge - a city uniquely qualified to help with this question. 

Why? 

Well, as home to the University of Cambridge it has been a place of education for over 800 years. And as home to The Eagle it has the pub where, on 28th February 1953, Crick and Watson announced they had discovered the structure of DNA. Learning and genetics … QED.

It’s a nice little route out of London and into the countryside to the east of the Lea Valley. Heading further north there isn’t a great deal of traffic on the B roads so we could concentrate on keeping a good pace. We could’ve done without the hailstorm though. Hailstones hurt.





We are definately improving as a team. Now we are managing to ride closer together it turns out that the energy saving effect of the peloton is no myth. When you are at the back you can cruise along with little effort as the guys in front do all the hard work. I can’t help imagining what it would be like with lots of people if it is this obvious with only the 3 of us… 

On a completely unrelated matter, if anyone wants to join us for a leg of the real thing then drop us a line!

After two less than satisfactory outings (see previous blogs) the Garmin was under particular scrutiny this week, but all things considered it actually performed pretty well. There was the occasional “blip”. We were guided first up a narrow footpath and secondly through a locked gate, but these were minor errors in comparison to what had gone before.








With the miles under our belts and a pint in our hands we got the news that 3,454 miles away, on the other side of the Atlantic, Henry’s training had kicked off ( ). The team was now complete. 

By the way, in the excitement of another good day in the saddle we never got round to considering the original question. Answers on a postcard...
