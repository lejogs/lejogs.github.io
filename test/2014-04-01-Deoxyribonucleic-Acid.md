Is cycling talent genetic or learned?

In the hope of finding an answer we set off on the 55 miles to Cambridge - a city uniquely qualified to help with this question.

Why?

Well, as home to the University of Cambridge it has been a place of education for over 800 years. And as home to The Eagle it has the pub where, on 28th February 1953, Crick and Watson announced they had discovered the structure of DNA. Learning and genetics ? QED.

It?s a nice little route out of London and into the countryside to the east of the Lea Valley. Heading further north there isn?t a great deal of traffic on the B roads so we could concentrate on keeping a good pace. We could?ve done without the hailstorm though. Hailstones hurt.
