For those that like a story to have a happy ending - this one does:

> Richmond welcomed us with open arms.

I certainly wont forget seeing
our names written in chalk on the road outside Jacko's parent's house,
a bountiful, delicious barbecue, the many friends and family that
stopped by to cheer us on or the whole keg of real ale we had waiting
for us. All of you are wonderful and it was fantastic to see you all.
It was a terrific end to a torrid day.

I think I'd probably heard the phrase 'sense of humour failure'
before, but never before has it been more useful. It's an expedient
way of saying I want to have a paddy but I know I'm now apparently
classed as an adult and that would be 'inappropriate' - today there
were a number of failures of various senses of humour. I will set the
scene:

In the lejogs camp there has been a running joke that today would be a
difficult day; that Jacko had routed us - perhaps unnecessarily - over
every hill in Yorkshire. As testament to this the team jersey has a
route map on it - a simple straight line joins ever stop... every stop
apart from the Rossendale to Richmond leg; this leg is joined by a
meandering S shape as it includes part of the Grand Depart from this
year's Tour de France. With ample trepidation we departed the
farmhouse in Rossendale after a delicious breakfast.

**Hill 1: Burnley Rd**
I might be able to list the hills - maybe; I can only do so with the
weary words of a shell shocked soldier, recalling after the fact a
meaningless blur, trying to impose order on chaos and extract meaning
from madness: The complaints started early from the team; at which
point Jacko stated that there were only 6 hills to climb today and
we'd just done one of them. This seemed manageable. As we would soon
find out, this would hinge keenly on what Jacko felt was a hill, and
not an 'undulation'.

**Hill 2: Skipton Old Road**
I can't honestly remember this one. I happened less than 12 hours ago,
I hope a similar protective amnesia will soon rob me of the rest of
the ordeal. Henry tells me that there was heather, that it was purple
and quite nice.

**Hill 3: Col de Cray**
Adam, Amy and their daughter Hannah (also Jacko's god-daughter) formed
our support team in the morning; it was fantastic to have their
enthusiasm at our backs and to be met with delicious sandwiches at
lunch - less so the knowing nods that passed between them. Col de Cray
was one of these moments - a hill they all knew, so much so that Amy
was stood halfway up to capture the exact moment that athleticism gave
way to the survival instinct. It was a tough climb but I told myself
it was the worst there was that day and we carried on.

On the way down the hill we say a 17% sign - much as you might do
seeing the same sign on a bottle of wine, we wondered if this was
entirely wise. Henry celebrated with a puncture. In a moment of
near-professionalism we were able (via the expertise of the support
team) to pass the necessary equipment back up the hill to Henry so he
could fix his tyre and continue.

At lunch we changed our support team to Henry's parents who diligently
followed and documented then last 3 ascents of the day.

**Hill 4: Buttertubs**
At this point the thematic crescendo of the day was clear - there
would be no let up, Jacko would use 'views' as a justification for any
amount of pain and Yorkshire wasn't going to be very forgiving. There
were 6 'hills' but countless undulations between then. Buttertubs I
think is a local euphemism along the lines of 'extraordinary
rendition' or 'highly kinetic interview' - it sounds fairly harmless,
but covers something particularly painful.
Halfway up the hill I saw another 17% sign. I'd just seen how
unmanageable this was to descend. Every part of my lower body was in
vocal agreement that whatever I was currently doing should stop
immediately, my knee excelled itself in producing a new kind of pain.
The hill continued.

As a slightly bizarre counterpoint, the road is still painted with the
markings from the Grand Depart.

I tried to imagine my name was Cav, or
Froome or Sky or Allez, they all seemed popular chaps and the road
willed them all on - at one point the road declared "Better to have
ridden and lost in Yorkshire than never to have ridden in Yorkshire at
all" - as our visitors might have said - au contraire.

Somehow, after a cattle grid, the hill ended, photos were taken, an
agreement was reached that something of merit had been achieved and we
moved on.

Seeing that the descent was 25% Henry celebrated in his people's
customary way with a puncture.

We rebuilt the tyre and readied
ourselves for the next assault. Senses of humour wavered.

**Hill 5: Fremington**
We saw a sign marked 'Richmond 21'. We turned off that road up a sharp
hill, I struggled up the hill, grimly keeping level with Jacko, a
final push took me over the (false) summit. "Oh. There's a bit more" -
I said. "No, not really, just a tiny bit". This as I saw soon after
was Jacko's diplomatic way of introducing the fact we'd got to
halfway. This was the moment that I had my sense of humour failure.
Asked at the top how I was doing I just stared at my shoes.

**Hill 6: Radio masts**
Henry was overcome with excitement and celebrated with a further
puncture on the approach to the final hill. I was mid tantrum /
tantric ascent and had reached the top before I knew much was wrong -
behind me, chaos was occurring.

The third (and then fourth) tube change of the day didn't exactly go
to plan, faulty valves, leaking gas canisters and torn tubes played
their part. Chris suffered the further ignominy of having his cleat
break and being forced to summit the entire hill on one leg.

I waited at the top with a huge swell of local support - Abigail,
Adam, Amy, Hannah, Helen, Jan. By the time the others reached the top
they'd been joined by another local (Dan) who had been waiting
patiently for the peloton to pass - it was handy to have someone that
actually knew the bends in the road on the way down rather than
playing chicken with approaching cars.

It was a short downhill on to Richmond and with that we had arrived to
a very warm welcome - Hannah leading the peloton in, to a cheering
crowd, bunting flapping in the wind and our names chalked in the road.

We all love you really Jacko. Even my knee
