After last weekend without a major ride (although a
lovely trip out to Beckenham to see James and Nic's new house and share a BBQ
with lots of good company), Jacko and I returned to the saddle.

>Rich was busy and Henry was still a few thousand miles away

We decided on a shorter
ride in the Surrey hills, this time choosing Leith Hill as a base to navigate
around.  A quick web search found us a Leith Hill Octopus route that we could
use, with five climbs up the hill via a few different routes.  The plan was 3600ft over 41 miles, starting
from Dorking

> a good thigh burning exercise!

It was on the train to Dorking that I realised I'm in the
wrong group for this ride.  As another couple of chaps got off the train in
front of us, saying, "straight in, or a nice cup of tea first?", I
realised where I should be, and slightly cursed militant Jacko under my breath.

 

Anyway, a short ride through Dorking and we arrived at
the hills. To be fair, just like I did for Box Hill, I'd built Leith Hill up
into some kind of Ventoux-like monster, which it really isn't.  While I won't
be-little anyone by saying that it's easy, it's not the beast that I thought it
might be:

>we have Brassknocker in Bath as a benchmark now...

The climb
isn't quite as friendly as Box Hill, mostly surrounded by a tunnel of trees and
with a less impressive lookout viewpoint, but I think I enjoyed it more. Some
of our routes were not ideal road-wise because of the gravel and potholes, but
we got up all of them without too much moaning.

 

What I took from this ride was that we're actually
getting quite cycling-fit, although you probably wouldn't think it to look at
us. We still averaged 15mph, despite the climbing (although a 45mph descent
helps!) and weren't overtaken by too many others - instead we were the ones
doing the overtaking.  This did feel very
much like a training ride, ascending and descending around the same point. I
think I prefer the A to B or loop approach rather than laps - I'd rather not
know what's coming up! However, knowing that the Plough Inn was at the end was
a decent incentive to keep ticking off ascent after ascent to get to the magic
number 5.

 

In other news, the Garmin behaved. Oh and as a timely
reminder of the importance of nutrition (which we pretty much ignored this
week), I was absolutely drained after the 10 miles in from Victoria to home.

 

So, 41 miles and another weekend closer to the trip -
with a chance to take inspiration from the tour riders in London over the next
week or so.
