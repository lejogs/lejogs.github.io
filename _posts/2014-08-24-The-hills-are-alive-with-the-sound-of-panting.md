That was tough. Chris, having looked at the total amount of hill
climbing we’ll do over the entire 1000 mile journey remarked that it
was the same as climbing Everest 2.2 times. After today I can see how
we’re going to get there.

A silver-tongued estate agent might duplicitously call today’s terrain
‘rolling’.

We started out today in Fowey where my parents had done a superb job
of hosting us. Unfortunately this may throw the rest of our
accommodation (Richmond excepted) into stark relief.

Sitting safely in a pub now, the hills feel like a happy, distant
memory. There are two that stick in the mind.

Our first moment of cycling took us onto a ferry, leaving on the other
side of the we passed Daphe De Maurier’s house and up a particularly
gruelling climb. Jacko - via Strava - has now be crowned

> ‘King of the Mountain’

 of this ascent - the fastest ascent ever… by a person using Strava -
high praise indeed.

Although slightly worryingly he is revelling in the schaudenfraude he
imagines will be befalling the previous holder: head in hands as he is
informed by Strava that he’s been beaten. Unable to look his wife in
the eye anymore he heads out this evening to regain his crown - still
beaten and half the man he felt yesterday he turns to drink and
spirals into oblivion. Richard Hamerton-Stove it’s OK, Jacko is over
8ft tall and it’s not really a fair fight

The second - a downhill so steep we couldn’t even get off the brakes
to enjoy it - found us hoping out loud that the other side of the
valley would be gentler. A helpful local, standing in his garden
informed us that no, it was just as steep the other side. One of us
got off to walk.

For every uphill there is a downhill and some of today’s have been
breathtaking. The view out over Bodmin Moor was spectacular. Stone
ruins and phallic shaped monuments in the foreground, across the
bracken and brambles of the moorland, to the fields of the valley
below, and onto the hills of the other side.

The front of the peloton during our downhills has gained the name of

> ‘test projectile’.

The winding country lanes, the chance that a car could ‘meet’ you at
any point, the countless potholes and the indifferent derision with
which the gravelly road surface meets any attempt at braking make it a
thankless task to be at the front.

Chris showcased his mettle today. At the point where his speed tipped
from reckless to insane he tried his brakes. The gravel could sense
the chance to claim a cyclist and let his back wheel snake wildly.
Changing tactic Chris decided to not brake... until he noticed the
junction approaching. Rapidly. He just about came to a halt and could
be seen laughing, slightly maniacally, as his adrenal glad squeezed
itself dry.

Today also saw our first guest rider - my Dad - also called Chris. I’m
going to pretend it was the fresh legs, but he was mostly found at the
front of the peloton, or waiting at the top of a hill. Although he did
find time to kindly wave past a car and come to

> a gentle halt in a hedgerow

I am informed that this was a deliberate manoeuvre and one that he has
practiced many times before.

This post needs a snappy finish, a conclusion and a meaningless Carrie
Bradshaw style life-lesson I’ve derived from the day. However the 20oz
mixed grill I’ve ordered has just arrived. So - see you tomorrow.
