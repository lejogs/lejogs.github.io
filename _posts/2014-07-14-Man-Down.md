If you’re reading these blog posts in order then you are probably slightly confused by Rich’s start to the last one (see Bruise Cruise).

> "From the moment I woke up on Sunday, and found myself wearing the bedsheet like a rudimentary cape - courtesy of yesterday’s wounds - it was destined to be something of an ordeal.”

The obvious questions are (a) what caused yesterday’s wounds and (b) what are they. Well, let me enlighten you...

With less than two months before we depart, this weekend had been planned as another where we could practice one day of riding after another. Chris had taken charge of route planning and decided that day 1 was to take in another 60 miles or so in the Chilterns.

It all started well enough.

The forecast rain meant that the sky was blue and the sun was shining in Tring as we disembarked the train from London Euston. Just over 18 miles later we’d climbed 1500ft and were feeling pretty good as our little peloton turned into a tree line lane. Rich was out front with myself and Chris following. 

We weren’t going particularly fast. All of a sudden I saw Rich’s bike buck like an angry bull, the front tyre flip right and Rich get catapulted along the road. It wasn’t the greatest sight ever and might have been worse had my brain, after what seemed like an age, not started to function and remind me to brake.

Rich was left lying in the road understandably yelling expletives so Chris and I decided that our natural instinct to laugh whenever somebody takes a fall - a skill finely honed over a number of ski holidays - should probably be suppressed until we could check our mate was ok. Rich later told us he was pretty disappointed with our decision.

As we went to help Rich I noticed someone in the distance. Walking up the lane from the far end was a lady followed shortly after by her husband. They had heard the shouts from their house and come to see what was going on. Finding Rich in his slightly dazed, pretty ripped up, but thankfully not broken state they invited us back to their beautiful house and garden to provide antiseptic spray, pain killers and even a new t-shirt. There was also an offer of a lift to the station but Chris and I, now back to normal, reminded Rich that when his dad had joined us for a training ride and fallen off he “manned-up” and carried on!

In all the fuss we never managed to find the names of our rescuers but their kindness was astonishing. Rich could not have picked a better place to crash! In case they ever read this … thank you.

[Note: Rich, it seems, has not been the first to take a tumble on the lane. There are a number of big tree roots that have caused the tarmac to lump up and in the shade it is almost impossible to see them until it’s too late. Apparently the local council have been told about it time and again but don’t seem that interested in fixing the problem.]

Excitement over we set off again to finish the remaining two-thirds of the ride. Plenty of glorious countryside and another 2500ft of climbing later saw us arrive in Twyford to catch the train back to London.

It wouldn’t really be right to say it was a successful day. The lack of skin on Rich’s shoulder, arm and left bum cheek don’t allow for that. But it was memorable for the climbs, a crash, and the kindness of two strangers.
