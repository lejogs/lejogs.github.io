Somehow in the chaos of helping my flat mate move out this morning I forgot
to have breakfast. Now, sitting on a train back to London, eating what to
any normal person would be a lacklustre station-bought sandwich, but which
my hunger has rendered purest ambrosia, I'm beginning to think that

A beautiful rain free day greeted me as I started out and I found myself
trying to remember the words of a work colleague who'd done the ride in the
past - there was

I vaguely remember it have a solid 'English' sounding name and him not being a big
fan of it.

Around 50 miles into the ride I saw a sign that brought his works back more
clearly

> Ditchling Beacon

That *is* a solid English name for a hill, I thought, internally
congratulating myself for the singularly useless way my mind had decided to
distill down my colleague's advice. Yes, Ditchling Beacon...

I'd like to say that the view from the top is worth the effort - it is a
nice view - but I think I'd spent so much time cursing on the way up I
wasn't ready to appreciate anything. As I took the picture of the view a
cyclist on a Brompton made it to the top, looking like his lungs were about
to burst and I suddenly very unfit straddling my super-light carbon-fibre
bike.

The Beacon slain it was a beautiful down hill into Brighton for the train.
Plenty more training needed, but it feels like progress.
