> Such a perfect day*.

Most days on the trip have seemed to have a ‘trial’ of some sort -
rain, headwinds, a broken bike, added crossings of the Clyde or
literally every single hill in the entirety of Yorkshire. Not today,
today has been a real pleasure, so what to write about? The closer we
get to the end of the trip the more the heady mix of excitement,
expectation, and tiredness creates a surreal delirium. Today, without
a trial to anchor the team, the delirium reached new heights:

It started early - the wonders of modern technology mean that you need
no longer be limited to a crowing rooster or church bells to wake you
on time, the iPhone, with a realistically captured ‘dog sound’ means
you can be shaken awake with all the care of a Guantanamo Bay inmate.
Chris had made the necessary arrangements and the 4 of us were

> brutalised awake by loud barking.

Chris wearily dragged himself from his slumber and - we should note at
this point that Chris has been somewhat ‘gastrically challenged’ of
late - grumbled about the painful immediacy with which he needed to
visit the ablutions. Chris is genuinely quite ill and I would have
extended him some empathy had he not shown me (and then texted his
lovely girlfriend) photographic evidence that would only really be of
diagnostic use to a proctologist.


This firmly set the tone for the day. The plan was to get out early
and make for Fort William - we made a very good pace, I struggled at
the back, riding the coat tails of the peloton - hoping the others
would let me off while I shook the sleep from my eyes. Fort William
was quickly achieved and Chris was very pleased to see a Wetherspoons
to avail himself of while we ordered breakfast. He found a few minutes
to visit a Boots before visiting the gents in our restaurant.

Soon after breakfast, and with Henry now running the peloton at a
fearsome pace we were, for the first time, in danger of being early
for lunch. Jacko actually uttered the words ‘we ought to stop or we’ll
be far too early’ - we found ourself at the end of Loch Laggan, where
Loch Laggan is joined by the Caledonian canal to Loch Ness. As an
aficionado of banal word play it was a joy to be able to explain to
Chris the way the canal system worked: The loch fills the lock, the
boat enters the lock, lock closed, the lock empties into the loch then
the lock opens and the boat leaves the lock for the loch.
Unfortunately for Chris the loos were also locked.

To keep spirits up Chris spent the next 10 miles asking if every body
of water of any description was Loch Ness. None was. Jacko patiently
corrected Chris, although I began to suspect he was beginning to make
up answers to silence him when he introduced ‘Lock Oink’,
unfortunately road signs later corrected my hearing of ‘Loch Oich’.

> Loch Ness sighted, Chris continued to regularly check on its name.

The early pace continued unabated and we were soon at lunch where we
met Chris’ parents. Jacko perhaps wary of previous feedback, presented
the team with a choice, there was the ‘A’ road, potential for traffic,
but very flat - or the ‘B’ road, very hilly - but quiet. The team
deliberated. The elevation profile of the morning showed the ‘B’ road
option rising between the flat morning and flat afternoon like a
single raised digit, like a giant ‘Yes’ vote to the Union. As if to
discuss the options dispassionately we asked what the rise of the hill
was (350m) and over what distance (5mi). Chris’ dad Graham pointed out
this was a particularly bizarre mix of metric and imperial. Of course
as any hill climbing aficionado would be aware that equates to 0.0435
lumen per candela.

We were tired of the lorries and nothing could be as horrific as The
Buttertubs -

> bring me the hill.

The hill was huge and tough, but - I almost choke to say it - the view
was worth it and, as we released a Chris shaped test projectile down
the hill at 14:21, the downhill felt incredible.

The downhill gave way to a roller coaster road that gave you the
opportunity to pedal as fast as you could on the downhill in the hope
of just cresting each uphill - and then onto the next. We ate up the
road to Inverness, stopping because we could rather than because we
had to and soon arrived in our immaculate B&B before heading out for a
delicious dinner with Chris’ parents (The Mustard Seed).
