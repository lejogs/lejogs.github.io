I learned a few things from this week's ride with the boys:


+ Organise more rides to start 5 minutes away from
my house so that I don't add to my lateness accumulator.

+  In the East, London very quickly disappears and
countryside starts (albeit Essex countryside, but hey ho, beggars can't be
choosers...).


We set out on a shorter-than-usual ride in the glorious
sunshine of a spring day at 10am.

do a u-turn and should, in fact, continue straight for a bit*

should do a u-turn and then take the left at the roundabout*


We were told, however, that we were still on the blue line,
so all was fine.


This was our first foray into Mark II of navigation
technology, the Garmin Edge Touring (Mark I being the trusty iPhone, sellotape
and breeze block sized battery pack solution). 
According to Garmin, the Edge Touring gives you


> *"the freedom to know you can find your way"*


It didn't.  It mostly
gave us comedy moments of route checking on an iPhone to validate the Garmin's
directions/usefulness.  The new piece of
kit reminded of a quote in a Sunday newspaper on Joe Kinnear being appointed as
Newcastle's Director of Football, "if Joe Kinnear is the answer, then I don't
know what the question is".  To be fair
though, we're now so used to Google Maps that a new, slightly crappier looking
mapping interface on a unit smaller than a phone was going to take a bit of
time to get used to, so I'm looking forwards to better times ahead, especially
on the unknown roads of LEJOG.  I also
have solid, first-hand experience of technology fail / user error from my
recent GoPro adventures on the ski slopes, so I won't give Jacko too much
abuse.  Although the Garmin has now been
dubbed


> *"the new GoPro"*


by Rich, which makes it obvious that he can see the value
add potential.


34 miles later, via some lovely roads through Epping Forest
in the unseasonably warm weather, we were outside a pub with a beer in hand,
confirming that we had, in fact, only ridden 24 miles and had missed the 10
mile loop at the top of Epping Forest (we had been following the blue line
though!).  We embraced the sunshine and beer
and made our way back to mine for some roast beef and homebrew.  As I'm writing this the day after, I can
confirm that the homebrew was a solid first batch.
