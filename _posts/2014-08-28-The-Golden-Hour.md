I'm sorry that this is 24 hours late. You can be sure that I've taken plenty of abuse for it already...

The time between 8am and 9am on the undulating roads north of Shrewsbury is known by LEJOGgers as 'The Golden Hour'. 

It is at this time, stomachs unburdened by an average fry-up from a well known hotel chain, and with thoughts of a bacon, sausage and egg bab waiting at the Dearnford lake caf√©, that a peloton flies along, eating up the miles with no effort at all. 

The cycling folk of Shrewsbury are generous, and we have to thank one of them - we shall call him Stan - for taking the lead for a few miles.

Of course this is a Hollywood-like depiction of long distance cycling and life is never this simple. This hour actually saw our first crash as Chris hit the deck. Luckily he was ok and we could carry on. He also deserves an honourable mention for making a lot less noise than Rich did when he crashed.

Breakfast over we experienced 'The Platinum Hour' where more rolling countryside, an August sun, and the power of the legs of Rich's dad drove the peloton to even greater speeds.

Lunch was provided in Warburton by our brilliant support crew before we entered the final stages of the day. 

The A57 round Manchester prefaced and a steady climb into the Lancashire countryside and our evening accommodation at a farm just outside Rossendale. 

An evening of tasty food and red wine provided a great end to a solid day in preparation for what was to follow...
