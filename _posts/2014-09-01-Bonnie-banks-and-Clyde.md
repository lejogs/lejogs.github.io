> Today started well.

With 92 miles to cover (our longest day) we decided to leave our
overnight accommodation early and get some miles under our belt. We
needed to time our departure carefully to make sure we could catch the
hourly ferry across the Clyde from Gourock, 22 miles away.

At bang on 7:45am we set off and quickly realised that due to the
traffic lights and various junctions to navigate in Paisley, an hour
and a half was going to be cutting it pretty fine. The time trial was
on and the team was ready for the challenge. As it happened, thanks to
the previous 8 days peloton training it was like taking candy from a
baby. With 6 minutes to spare we arrived in Gourock and got straight
on the ferry to Dunoon.

Half an hour later we arrived at the other side of the Clyde and
decided to get a well deserved brew. The Garmin was also doing its
‘thing’ again and failing to find the route towards Loch Lomand so a
local bakery seemed like a sensible place to sort it out. With a cup
of tea and a warm scone in hand I set to the task. It didn’t take long
to realise the problem. It wasn’t the Garmin … we’d got on the wrong
ferry.

A quick look at Google Maps showed us the scale of the problem we’d
left ourselves. Back to Gourock or an extra 20 miles over an unknown
topography.

At 11:18, two hours after we’d originally planned, we were on the
ferry to Kilcreggan. For those of you who are interested in numbers,
if “Pennines crossing” = 2 then “Clyde crossing” = 3…

For the next 30 miles we were on it. More specifically Chris was on
it. He led us through submarine country at about a hundred miles an
hour - or that’s how it felt. In no time at all we were on the road
along the bonnie banks of Loch Lomand and bearing down on our lunch
stop.

It’s worth an interlude at this point to discuss our support crews.
Rich’s mum (and dad when he wasn’t cycling) set the standard very high
and a mixture of Brian (my mate’s wife’s dad), my parents, and my
uncle and aunty have kept up the fine tradition over the last few
days. Chris’ dad was only meant to join us to take on the
responsibility from tomorrow morning but arrived at lunch and
immediately stepped up to the mark. A timely pre-order of steak
sandwiches and chips allowed an F1 style pit stop then back on the
road for an afternoon of climbing.

Scotland’s epic Highland countryside opened up in front of us and we
got some fantastic views. For a short time the mist rolled in and the
wind picked up to make the experience one that Henry accurately
described as

> “cycling through glue”.

It didn’t last too long but was quite enough for us to thank the
weather gods for the high pressure area that is currently keeping the
rain away.

We paid homage at the legendary Green Welly Stop before a long climb
up to the magnificent desolation of Rannoch Moor and finally down into
Glencoe. With spectacular mountains on either side we cruised to the
valley floor before taking a right, past the Clachaig Inn, and to our
lodgings for the evening. A quick turn around and we were back up the
road to the Clachaig for food, drink and whisky…

… and we are still here.
