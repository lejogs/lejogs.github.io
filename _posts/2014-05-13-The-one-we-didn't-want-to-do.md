It was bound to happen eventually. It was, as they say, inevitable.

We knew in advance that Rich couldn't make a ride this weekend and things steadily deteriorated from there. The weather didn't help. Cloudy, windy, heavy rain showers - altogether pretty miserable. Chris wasn't feeling well and I was suffering a bit after agreeing to "one more for the road" the night before. 

The combination of these events was enough to create the training day we'd long been expecting...

In the interests of full disclosure, I didn't have a very high opinion of us. I'd always assumed that faced with such a situation we'd choose to sack off the ride in favour of the pub. It was therefore a proud moment when decided to just get on with it!

The route was our second attempt around Epping forest and into the Essex countryside - the last one ending in failure thanks to the unique navigational capabilities of the Garmin (see "The Only Way is Essex" and blogs passim). 

This time we got it right and weren't disappointed. The undulating narrow country lanes made us quickly forget the reasons we had almost stayed in London. 

Even the 10 miles back to town into a strong headwind couldn't quell our spirits as we managed to keep an average speed of 15mph. This would not have been possible a couple of months ago.

So all's well that ends well...

Well, almost. At the traffic lights in Stratford a plastic carrier bag got caught in my chain, it jammed, and the rear derailleur sheared off my bike. Maybe this was the one we didn't want to do!
