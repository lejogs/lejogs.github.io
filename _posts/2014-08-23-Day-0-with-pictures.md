Firstly and mostly, I have to thank you all so so much for all the kind
support you have lent us - and the support you have shown LLR. I didn't
realise when we started out how proud we'd feel that it will actually mean
something to travel the 1000 miles ahead of us. I am particularly touched
to see that Kevin and Kathy have lent their support - I came off my bike
outside their house and they patched me up and sent me on my way.

> And so it begins

The four of us meet - auspiciously for only the second time - in a pub near
Paddington station. The sort of preparation I imagine precedes most major
sporting events. The air is tense, there are still some key decisions to
make; the success of our entire enterprise depends on them - sausage and
mash, or pie of the day. Lengthy research determines that the pie of the
day is boar. Boar.

I am surrounded by an unreasonable amount of kit for such a short journey.
The most important piece thereof is the Brompton - should your bike fail,
it will be there - ready to carry you on its tiny tiny wheels; the hard
leather saddle providing unwanted, almost aggressive support. I know - I
cycled 300 consecutive miles on it - I was told by the salesman that 'the
saddle moulds itself to you - it breaks itself in' - it doesn't, if
anything it broke me in. Its vigil starts today.

Soon it was time for us to board the 'Riviera Sleeper' - much as it sounds
like a sun-drenched French terrorist cell it's actually a surprisingly well
delivered overnight train service. As I sit typing this, with a whiskey in
hand, it seems like this might be the start of something great - or perhaps
in the words of Hemmingway

your mouth shut.'

It's time to put the laptop away and get some sleep.
