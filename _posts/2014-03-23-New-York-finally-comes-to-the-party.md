> No excuses...

... or so they say, but in this particular case, I think the brutal winter
has provided at least several valid reasons not to venture out on a road
bike, including almost half a metre of snow, a mean temperature of 0
Celsius and low of -16 Celsius so far in 2014 and that doesn't include the
additional snow forecast for this Wednesday. However, with Spring
definitely in the air, on occasion, and having invested in both winter
shoes and a long-sleeved top that were in danger of becoming too warm, I
decided I couldn't hold out any longer. And so it was, while enjoying a
cold Magners on a warm Saturday afternoon, that I made plans to venture out
the next morning, making a tentative start to my training regime with a 30
mile spin around the borough of Brooklyn.

> Refusing to make it easy,

the weather reverted back to a steady 0 Celsius, not accounting for a gusty
breeze and the, sporadic, forward movement of the bike. Not expecting to
cover ground particularly quickly in the city, I was happy to complete the
[round trip to Coney Island](http://www.mapmyfitness.com/workout/514870565)
in under 3 hours, by which time I was in desperate need of a hot shower -
my core and toes were toasty, but I'd lost most of the feeling in my
fingers. It's always nice to explore new parts of the city though - Sunset
Park, while not particularly inspiring, has a great park looking back over
the harbour to Manhattan.
