Football - 'tis oft said - is a game of two halves. As lazy aphorisms go, it's an apt one - this week's cycle ride was definitely

> a game of two halves.

The first half was characterised by sprawling London, lots of traffic and a general agreement that the ride was a little bit rubbish. The Garmin did it's "thing" too.

Stretching the metaphor to breaking point, half-time came as we entered the lovely town of Sevenoaks, we began to marvel that perhaps we'd left the never-ending traffic and - as I would later regret - we passed a deer park. The four of us, joined this week by my dad, (who for the sake of confusion is also called Chris) looked left in unison to appreciate the lovely deer park. At this point my dad struck a cone in the middle of the road and came off his bike, puncturing a tire, snapping the gears off his handlebars and brusing his hip. Most gallingly,

We somehow cobbled the bike back together, patching the tyre, 'fixing' the gears (who needs a back brake) and dad was back on his way. It was only later, on seeing the size of the bruise, that I realised quite how hard it must have been to complete the remaining 45 miles. Kudos.

The nadir of broken bikes and bruised riders reached, we climbed literally and metaphorically towards the second half. The traffic abated, the scenery improved and the four of us found ourselves thundering down deserted country roads and across beautiful salt marshes towards Hastings.

The ride (at 81 miles) is about as far as we've gone and the vertical ascent (~5000ft) makes it our hilliest proposition to date. The gut-wrenching sound of a cycle crash is something I hope won't grace our trips again although I'm sure we'll continue with the mantra of

if any of us is laid low by mechanical failure. Today, with aching legs I'm a little glad we've got a week off to enjoy the bank-holiday next weekend!
