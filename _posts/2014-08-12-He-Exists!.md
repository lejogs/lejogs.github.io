I'm writing this a few weeks late, primarily due to laziness on my part,
but...

> Henry exists, and he can ride a bike!

Andria and I were invited to the most incredible evening of dinner, drinks
and dancing, surrounded by many friends, new and old.  This was in the
heart of Kent at Henry's parents' house.  Henry and I made plans to head
out on the bikes in the afternoon,

> to say we'd done at least one training ride together

Our adventure took us out with Henry's youngest brother, Will, a LEJOG and
Etape veteran, or cycling oracle in our eyes...  We ventured out on one of
his old training routes, a 35-miler with a couple of decent hills and some
stunning countryside.

Keeping this, belated, post short and sweet.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable
ride; lots of chat, lots of tips and tricks from Will - including the most
important advice to avoid Yorkshire (cue "you're all mad!" chat) - cheers
Jacko, grrrr...
