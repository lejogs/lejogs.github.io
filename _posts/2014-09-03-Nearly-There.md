Today was meant to be the day after we

> broke the back of it

It was meant to be easier - the finish line in sight, the final battle
before we are expected to win the war.  It was, in fact, a tough day.
 Without really understanding why, we started off slowly and never really
picked up any sort of head of steam until the late afternoon.

We did pass some absolutely stunning scenery.  Rolling out of Inverness in
the morning led us straight onto the Kessock Bridge over the Beauly Firth,
a decent start to the day, before we quickly rode to our first climb.  This
would be the way of the morning, slowly climbing up out of Inverness and to
the North, avoiding the A9 wherever possible (thanks mostly to great route
planning from Jacko).  We wound our way through the countryside, over more
firths and past more lochs until we reached our lunch stop in Lairg.  My
dad observed that a couple of girls and a chap had been through just before
us, as a passing reference to seeing other cyclists - this would provide us
with some amusement later when we reached the pub.  A visit to the chippy
in Lairg set us up for an afternoon of climbing towards Tongue.

This was beginning to feel like a filler section - the joy of getting up to
Glencoe a distant memory, the anticipation of arriving in John O'Groats a
(hopefully) soon realisation.  We were somewhere in the middle.  This
needed a pub.  Thankfully we found one, in the middle of nowhere - The
Crask Inn.  We decided to head in for a pint, where we met the two girls
mentioned above, who were cycling with their mum.  Top work to my dad for
sighting out the mum as a bloke, cue a few giggles on our part in the pub.
 We treated ourselves to a pint next to the roaring furnace and then got
back on our way.  The last section into Tongue was some of the most
incredible scenery that we'd had all day, but sadly we wanted to get the
filler over so it went by a little unappreciated, and to rub salt in its
wounds the final hill was

> 'smashed' by Jacko and Rich, delighting in their efforts to belittle it
as they flew up at 16mph - poor hill...

The final miles from the pub to Tongue also introduced us to the new
nutrition that we could take on board while flying downhill, and also the
one thing that made us not stop riding - the midge.

> Bring on tomorrow...
