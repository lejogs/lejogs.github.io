> Today started well, primarily because it wasn’t yesterday,


but also because the sun was shining and the wind was gentle. A full
cooked breakfast, now standard, served as fuel for our cycling
furnaces and, as appropriate for our first full day in Scotland,
included some tasty black pudding and potato pancakes. We bid adieu to
our fantastic Richmond based support team, having completed the
handover of Jacko’s stand-in bike from yesterday, and look forward to
seeing them welcome us in John O’Groats.


> Our route to the outskirts of Glasgow


shadowed the M74 for the most part, as it rises through the Southern
Highlands of South Lanarkshire. Although the team’s spirit was
encouraged by the almost perfect conditions, progress was slow and an
early rear-wheel blow out threatened to derail our hopes for a day
free from major mechanical troubles. The peloton soon gathered pace
though and we were enjoying a good cuppa at our first 15 mile stop and
in very real danger of actually enjoying the ride. Progress was
steady, despite South Lanarkshire’s best efforts to throw us the worst
possible road conditions, (voting Yes to spending more on road
maintenance in Scotland would be the only Yes vote this team would
cast) and we were enjoying views across the highlands, studded with
the vast wind turbines of the Clyde Wind Farm.


> Against this backdrop of natural beauty,


at our second stop, we were treated to Chris demonstrating how to
liberally apply chamois cream (used to keep a bikers’ undercarriage
fresh for any who may not be familiar with a professional cyclist’s
medicine cabinet), a sight which certainly cut short any further faff
and got us on our way again. We managed to provided lunch for
ourselves at the M74’s Abington Services, where we set eyes on another
LEJOG team for the first time. Immediate comments about how amateur
they looked in comparison, particularly with respect to their kit,
were quickly proven, as we sped past them with the city of Glasgow on
the horizon, despite their setting off from lunch before us. The
team’s arrogance is clearly in one piece, even if our bodies our
slowly coming apart.


> Our legs tired and spirits flagged as another long day wore on,


but we dug deep and made it to our pub/hotel for the night in Paisley,
without any Glasgow kisses from the locals to welcome us.
