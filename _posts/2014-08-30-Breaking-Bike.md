Not many groups doing LEJOG cross the Pennines twice. We did. Via the
Yorkshire Dales. Even with the rest day thrown in, these two days of riding
have been a battle. The Grand Départ has been covered previously, so I'll
start with our rest day. After a phenomenal BBQ at Chez Jack, we slept in,
took our bikes to be patched up for the next 500 miles and, inevitably,
went to the pub. After a couple of solid pints of Black Sheep we were
treated to an incredible massage from Helen's friend, Louise. The best part
of the massage was watching justice be delivered to Jacko, the man never
seen near a foam roller or massage bed before, yelping in pain as Louise's
hands worked their way over his thighs with, quote, "hardly any pressure".
Man up Jacko, man up.

A fantastic feed was delivered by Jan to set us up for today's ride. So on
to the ride...

The pains of the Grand Départ still with us, Henry now taping both knees,
Rich wincing as each pedal turn shot pain through his knee, we turned out
of Sycamore Avenue onto the immediate 16% hill and started climbing.

The countryside was absolutely stunning as we climbed our way, slowly, up
through North Yorkshire, County Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland. The
North Pennines landscape provided a more  rolling, bleak backdrop than
Thursday's green fields and sharply rising hillsides. The only problem so
far, a huge headwind that was battering us as we wound our way up the
Teesdale valley side. As lots of pedal turns were being put in for very
little reward, we finally saw our first real mechanical casualty of the
tour (punctures and pedals aside) as Jacko's rear derailleur snapped clean
off his bike at a particularly innocuous moment, leaving him pretty much
"up sh*t creek" (more justice? We couldn't laugh at this one - this is a
day ending failure on a newly serviced bike...). Where to go from here?
Well, our support crew have been incredible to date, but this was to become
a new benchmark. Cue Jan and Jim. I know they are teachers, I know teachers
are organised, I know it was slightly lucky that they were parked up just
in front of where the mechanical happened in order to take photos, but the
speed and skill of organisation was phenomenal:  Jacko's old mountain bike
was whipped off the back of the motor home, the pedals were swapped to make
the afternoon marginally easier, the local bike shop in Richmond was
contacted, an early lunch was taken in the comfort of the lounge of the
mobile home - with a very welcome spread served up by Jan.  We went on our
merry (hah!) way, into the wind, protecting Jacko with a twosome riding at
the front of the peloton. The Jacks made their way back to Richmond, to
become Richmond for a workaround, Darlington for a part, back to Richmond
for a full repair. Incredible. As I write this, the Jacks are en route to
deliver a fully working bike back to Jacko for tomorrow's ride.

Did anything else happen on the ride? No. It was a slog. I feel absolutely
broken, pleased that I helped to drag Jacko to Annan on a bike that can
only have been hurting him with every pedal stroke, pleased that the team
got him through. We did cross the border, which was worth a photo.

I have
a beer in front of me. I am with the team. This was a brutal day, but the
first major test of the team. I think we passed.
