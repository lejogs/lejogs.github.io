Cyclists, sailors and alfresco urinators all know

> it's a lot more difficult into the wind

Next time I'm going to check the weather forecast.

Another good training ride for team LeJog, repeating the route of my
previous solo ride, Chris, Jacko and I set out to Brighton - the wind was
unimpressed and resolved to blow directly against us for the entire journey.

We overcame the wind and the hills to rewarded ourselves with some
delicious fish and chips on the sea front.

Honourable mentions:

**Chris**:
*  providing some incredible salted caramel + chocolate brownies (from Bad
Brownie) to revive tired legs

*  only being 3 minutes late

* creative use of gaffer tape in a supporting role

**Jacko**:
* losing his Garmin by hiding it in his pocket
