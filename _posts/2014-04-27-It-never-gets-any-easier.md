If ever we had occasion to doubt the words of three time Tour de France champion Greg LeMond then Saturday’s ride brought us back to earth with a bang.

To be fair, we didn’t have the best of preparations. 

Chris spent Friday evening destroying his thighs with a brutal spin class, Rich was up late attempting to manufacture curds for a homemade <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine'>poutine</a>, and I went out for a Thai curry which it turned out probably contained ingredients that were not 100% fresh. On top of all this we’d missed out on doing a training ride the previous weekend.

So thighs burning (Chris), poutine yearning (Rich) and stomach churning (me) we set off to the south west of London and out through Richmond Park into the Surrey Hills.

The BBC had forecast a miserable day of rain, which of course meant that the weather was actually a pretty nice. There was a 5 minute stint of hail, but nothing worth complaining about.

In between the cycling Mecca of Richmond Park and the cycling Mecca of Box Hill we rolled through the Surrey countryside tackling each incline as it came. A slog to a summit was always rewarded by a long downhill run which replaced the pain of the climb with the fear of the fast descent.

The final climb was up Box Hill and we were greeted at the top by a flapjack and a fantastic view of the countryside before heading back towards London.

Arriving back we were exhausted but a quick check of the stats made for very happy reading. 75 miles in less than 5 hours (an average pace of 15.5mph) and in this time we’d climbed almost 3000ft.

Turns out Greg LeMond might have known what he was talking about.
