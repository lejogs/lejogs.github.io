And so it began.  I thought in the aftermath that I was just very unprepared.  The definition for that is 'having made inadequate preparations'.  Given that we're only at the beginning of this journey then it can't really be that one.  Hmmmmmm, so what could it be?  
Definition of 'unfit'...
Yep, that's the one.  So the Christmas excess, which has actually been an extended Christmas period from about last summer until now, started to show as I grimaced my way around our first training ride.  Well at least it's the kick up the backside that I needed.  It was a stark lesson that gave my 'how hard can it be' approach a bit of a kicking.  This is actually going to be incredibly hard work, with some long days and nights of training; both on the bike and in the gym.  Damn the fact that a nice new bike doesn't turn you into a yellow jersey winner overnight (or maybe I just didn't buy the jersey to go with it?).  But hard work pays off, and this is the beginning.
For me, the first ride was a blur of burning thighs and the shame of being left embarrassingly far behind at the sight of every tiny incline.  Plus some nice views of the Kent/Surrey borders, but they were quickly forgotten as my mind focussed back on the thighs.  Oh, the thighs.
To be fair, I didn't moan (until now) and neither did the boys, who had to constantly wait at the top of every hill until Captain Slow finally appeared.  It's at times like these when you realise that you're going to be in good company for the months ahead.  It's also at times like these when you realise that this is just the beginning, and that we're here to put in some hard yards; both on the riding and the money raising front.  So, to the gym for the second time this week, hill setting enabled, pedals slowly turning...
A massive thanks to Rich and Jacko for a few things so far:
1.  Doing a sterling job on the tech front2.  Being very patient on the first ride3.  For proudly singing the praises of new Gatorskin tyres, to then have a puncture 10 minutes later
Here's to having some fun, and raising a lot of money for a very worthy cause.
