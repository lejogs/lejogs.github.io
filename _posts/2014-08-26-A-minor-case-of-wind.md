> After yesterday,

Almost any weather could be considered an improvement, and while swapping
rain for wind might be deemed an improvement if we were sailing to JOG,
unfortunately this is not our chosen mode of transport. So it was that we
were waved off by the king of the YHA St Briavels castle, who had been a
very accommodating host, on a very blustery, but mostly dry, day in the
west of England. We choose a particularly scenic spot by the A49, which was
to become as near and dear in our hearts as the A38 had the day before, for
our first snack break. Rescuing Jacko's tool pack from the path of a
speeding lorry and the loss of several shower caps, that had kept our heads
dry the day before but whose elastic was not designed for high winds,
seemed like the only distractions from an endless slog into the wind on our
way to Shrewsbury. Oh, and that we'd remain unscathed by the speeding vans
and lorries that would buffet us with spray, noise and debris - good news,
we did.

> That was until we reached lunch.

A full plate of spag bol, extra garlic bread and a sticky toffee pudding
with custard in a friendly restaurant in Ludlow, put all of us into a
premature food coma, of the kind that's usually reserved for after dinner.
This, combined with the mis-selling of the final climb of the day as
"gentle", had the team digging deep to get across the finish line in
Shrewsbury. Here, again, Mrs Bradish had excelled in her role as team
manager/chef/coach, being, as she was, with key cards in hand at the
Premier Inn, ready to usher us out of the wind and into the warmth. The
evening's entertainment took the form of a gathering of extended family and
friends for a fish supper, swapping tales from former JOGLE-ers and on the
finer points of handling a Go Pro, as a result of which you may be able to
enjoy some live action coverage in days to come here on the blog (although
as Chris is involved in this, no guarantees I'm afraid).

> For now though,


It's time to get some rest and prepare for another tough day in the saddle,
as we head north to Rossendale tomorrow - at least the forecast is dry, so
no shower caps required.
