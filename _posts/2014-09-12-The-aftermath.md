> It seems vaguely appropriate


that I start writing this as my New York bound flight accelerates towards
its cruising speed of 600mph across the west of Great Britain, at which
speed our 12 day accomplishment would be reduced to a mere 100 minutes.
However, I shall banish further thought of the alternative modes of
transport we could have used to traverse the length of the mainland British
Isles and instead focus on the massive sense of achievement we all feel,
the amazing support we had both along the way and from all those who
donated so generously.



> But first, to our final day.


Spirits were soaring as we sat down to breakfast and the realisation set in
that this would indeed be the final time we’d be kitting up for yet another
day in the saddle. However, this euphoric high was quickly replaced by a
low as heavy as the huge cooked breakfast we’d just devoured, as the final
63 miles of rolling Scottish coast to Thurso beckoned. Despite a slow
start, our continued luck with the weather helped us make good time through
some stunning scenery – the peloton casting a flitting shadow on the scrub
and the echoes of classic film soundtracks bouncing off the dry stone walls
as we sang along to Jacko’s playlist, brought out as special motivation on
our final day. Thurso was the destination for one last lunch with our
support crew and, having wolfed both savoury and sweet pies, a mere 20
miles separated us from the finish line which, once onto the flatlands of
the Caithness peninsula, we consumed almost as quickly as lunch. We had
overtaken the 3 LEJOG ladies very early in the day but were quite surprised
to have the other team of 4 LEJOG lads in our sights with only 5 miles to
go, as they had left the B&B just as we were tucking into our first
mouthfuls of black pudding and kippers. Obviously, not content to linger
and let them beat us to it, the peloton tucked in one last time and powered
past them on a final incline, to mutterings of “Sh*t they’re fast!” from
their outrider. Feeling exceptionally smug, regardless of the fact that
we’d placed first in a race only we knew was being run, we sailed through
the final few turns until we reached the short downhill to the finish line.



> In most other circumstances,


you wouldn’t be able to help feeling distinctly unimpressed by John
O’Groats, however, as we spotted Mr & Mrs Jack in the road with cameras at
the ready, we felt the same elation that I’m sure Team Sky felt when
crossing the line in Paris at last year’s Tour du France (we contemplated
trying the arms in the air / shoulder to shoulder but the substantial
difference in saddle and torso heights would likely have prevented us from
reaching the line at all). And so it was that we came to a stop by the
famed signpost, 1008 miles and X feet climbed from where we started, the
champagne started flowing and the cameras clicking. The arrival of Mr & Mrs
Walters brought a further round of hearty congratulations and champagne.
Despite the jubilation, we managed to retain a reasonable level of
graciousness as we took a couple of minutes from all the self-adoration to
cheer in the losing LEJOG lads and even offer them a consolation shot of
champagne.



> The remainder of the afternoon and evening was spent revelling in our
accomplishment


with several rounds of celebratory beers in the bar of the Seaview Hotel
which, although very closely resembling a working mens club, did little to
dampen our spirits. Exhaustion finally set in after a hearty feed and
whiskey night cap with the support crew, and we retired to our bunkhouse to
enjoy a very well-earned night’s sleep. The journey back to London involved
zigzagging our way across what seemed like most of the Scottish highlands
over the course of the afternoon to get to Inverness in time for an early
supper before boarding the Caledonian Sleeper.


> And before we knew it,


we were waking up as the train rolled into Euston and the whole
adventure/experience/ordeal almost seemed like a distant dream in the
chilly morning London air. With a brief interlude for Jacko as he made a
superhuman effort to play his best friend down the aisle, we all spent the
weekend doing a sum total of not very much, as we ate, sat and slept our
way back to some sense of normality. I had allowed myself a few days to
recover before returning to New York and so was able to catch up with Rich
and Jacko for more eating and sitting. Unfortunately, Chris was already
working hard back in Hamburg, but his presence was not missed, replaced as
he was at the table by an upturned coffee cup in the disappointing absence
of any chamois cream – word on the street was that a recent LEJOGer bearing
a striking resemblance to Chris had bought up every pot in the city.



> Our achievement would not have been possible without our dedicated
support crew, to whom we extend our enormous thanks,


who were, in order of appearance: Mr & Mrs Bradish; Adam, Amy & Hannah; Joe
& Margaret; Mr & Mrs Bruce; Mr & Mrs Jack; Louise, the team physio; Mr &
Mrs Walters. Equally, a huge thanks to everyone who donated so generously
that we smashed our first fund-raising target of £5k and proceeded to
exceed our final target of £6k to raise £6800.77 (as of posting this, with
more expected)!



> What’s next for the team I hear you ask?

Whatever it is, and there’s been no agreement as yet, it’s likely to be
completed at a slightly more leisurely pace, such that we don’t all feel
the need for a proper holiday afterwards!
