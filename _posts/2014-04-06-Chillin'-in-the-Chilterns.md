After missing last weekend's ride I was very keen to get back on the metaphorical horse as team LEJOG chalked up another day's training.

The Chilterns Cycleway is a 170 mile circular cycle route through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty just to the north west of London. 

We had decided that 170 miles was probably a bit of a stretch at this point in our training - or ever - so instead opted to do the north eastern section which is 73 miles between Tring and Berkhamsted. 

On this face of it this would seem to be the definition of "pointless" as  Berkhamsted is actually just 7 miles from Tring. But the rolling countryside, narrow lanes and beautiful villages proved this less direct route is totally worthwhile.

We met at Euston station where Chris and Rich seemed genuinely pleased to have me back on the team. However, as the ride progressed and we passed brilliant looking pub after brilliant looking pub after ... well, you get the picture ... they began to sound less pleased at the new level of discipline imposed (see last week's blog) and actually suspect I was taunting them. The cry of "pub" became more strangled with every shout.

My return to the team also brought with it the return of punctures. It turns out that Gatorskin tyres are not immune to getting a hole in the side wall and once this happens the inner tube doesn't stand a chance. Twice. 

Oh well, it's all good practice and meant that Chris could deploy his new tyre inflating gadget. Luckily this is much less temperamental than either the GoPro or the Garmin and worked like a dream. One second the tyre is flat and the next it's at 120psi and we were ready to roll again.

It turns out we climbed 3882ft which surprisingly is more than the lads did on Box Hill the previous weekend. Cue plenty of chat about legs hurting and an evening of "middle-distance staring".

So, another successful and very enjoyable ride. There are another 97 miles to cover so we'll definitely be heading back to the Chilterns at some point soon.
