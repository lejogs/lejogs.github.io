Got the astoundingly crap song 'Love is All Around' to the top of the
UK charts in 1994 for 15 weeks.  That's about how long it felt like we
were riding for in the pouring rain today.  We expected rain, and
actually knew today was going to be pretty miserable, but actually
being in it really is something else.  This blog will be short as for
one of the few times today I am warm, dry and near a pub.


We spent most of the day with a trail of water from the person in
fronts back wheel heading straight from tyre to mouth, getting
poleaxed by the rain, wearing shower-caps over our helmets.


A few special mentions:


1. Hazel (again...  3 days of incredible support, but we could lose
her soon to Team Sky).  An amazing lunch spread in about the only
place of shelter alongside a railway line, together with a set of dry
clothes for the afternoon stint.

2. Jacko.  A driving force at the front of the peleton during
aforementioned stint.

3. The hill into St Briavels.  For not being as bad as the profile on
ridewithgps suggested.


I'm writing this from the chapel of our castle, the YHA in St
Briavels.  It's an incredible place to be spending the night, but most
of all, it has hot showers.
