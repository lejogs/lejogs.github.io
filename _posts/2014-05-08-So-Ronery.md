Riding without the boys was difficult.
> *I'd love to say I missed the conversation, or the morale boosting words of wisdom, or at least the evening of middle distance staring*
It was really the peloton effect / wind break that I needed.  Battling alone with a headwind was particularly tricky, and knackering.
Choosing a route from my parents' house on the Nottinghamshire / Derbyshire borders to Stone in Staffordshire to watch some Minor Counties cricket was, in theory, pretty easy.
Either go down the A6 and face near death, or head into the Peak District to enjoy some scenery coupled with a few tricky climbs.  I obviously chose the latter, and picked some well recommended trails to plan to ride along.  I had the now infamous Garmin to guide me, and the backing of internet research that all trails were more than suitable for riding on 700x23c road bike slicks.
The Garmin held up pretty well.  I only had a few occasions of
> *'turn around at the next available opportunity'*
when I was about a mile from the final destination on a straight road with no other way of getting there, or
> *'turn right now'*
when the only available right turn was onto an active / busy railway line.
It found my chosen trails pretty easily.  The trails themselves, however, were another matter.  A couple were fine but busy with walkers, making for a very stop-start journey.  I realised that road surface makes a huge difference to your speed.  Even on the non-crowded moments of towpath running alongside the, admittedly very pretty, Cromford Canal, I was barely able to top 13mph - once on tarmacked road I could easily bang out a respectable 15mph without much thought or effort.
My journey took me from home, via a few roads and canal towpaths out to the start of the High Peak Trail (which follows the track-bed of the former Cromford and High Peak Railway, a casualty of the Beeching era).  I was expecting a pretty aggressive welcome to the Peaks, and got it.  Not just a steep hill, but one on a muddy trail, full of walkers, with wooden beam steps cut into parts of the hill.  I was very pleased to just about get enough grip out of my slicks to make it up this first hill, to be floored by a diversion past a closed part of the trail where I had to carry my bike on my shoulder to walk over tree roots and rocks.  Hopefully there won't be many of those on the actual ride!
The view, however, from the top back into the valley was stunning, so I can probably say that it was worth it.  A short stint along the flat brings you to the next climb - the Middleton incline, a 700m long stretch of 12.5% gradient.  This would have been a fairly tough, but do-able climb, if the road surface hadn't been made of gravel.  With my back wheel going round and me going nowhere fast as the surface gravel got finer and finer, I had to get off and walk the last 100m to the summit.  Again though, the view was probably worth the walk.
The next stretch was a flat ride along more gravel on the peak tops with some stunning scenery in all directions.  This was where I wore the brunt of the wind, but it was still an enjoyable stretch.  I left the trail at Hartington (Derbyshire's home of Stilton cheese) and wound my way up the (many) Staffordshire hills into Stone to the cricket ground for a well-deserved pint (thanks Steve H for the welcoming Wainwrights!).  I though the Peaks would be rough, but Staffs had some punchy climbs to get the legs burning!
So, a first foray alone.  I have to say that it reinforced the effect of the peloton, and I did miss the company of Rich and Jacko.  Stopping to eat a chocolate bar or gel for fuel always ended up being a bit of a soul destroying
> *'get it down and get on the bike again'*
as there was nothing else to do!  With the boys we at least have a bit of a laugh at something for a few minutes, a collective moan, and then get on our way again.
Thanks are due to the Garmin for not leaving me in the Outer Hebrides, and for Jacko for letting me use it!  Also thanks to Steve H for the lift back from Stone, and making me feel like a true tour racer by anticipating my route and then chasing me down in a support car style!  My 40mph hill descent to try to catch him after he went past in the car was a lot of fun. 		 	   		  <figure class="half">
