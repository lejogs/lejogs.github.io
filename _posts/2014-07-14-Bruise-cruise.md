From the moment I woke up on Sunday, and found myself wearing the bedsheet
like a rudimentary cape - courtesy of yesterday's wounds - it was destined
to be

> something of an ordeal.

I got to the agreed startpoint - Royal Inn, Victoria Park - to find it
closed
for a world cup party, the bacon sandwich I had promised myself evaporated.
This being the highly gentrified part of Hackney I settled for a cafe that
kindly served a toasted chicken and avocado baguette - Chris snorted
derisively into his coffee about it being possibly

> the most middle class way to start a bike ride.

Then spent the next hour whining that he hadn't had any breakfast.

Jacko arrived with encouraging news of technical failures: the Garmin had
only a bit of battery and no route. I quietly hoped these problems were
insurmountable, or failing that, that it would buy me at least enough time
for
another coffee. Alack - within 5 minutes we'd paid up and visited Walters'
Towers whence a new cycle route was immediately procured. And so the cycling
began.

With characteristic stoicism Jacko took the lead and pegged our pace at 20
miles per hour, Chris and I grumbling at the back, mostly for the sake of
tradition. This being only a 50 miler we did 17 miles each before changing
the lead. A Nisa - purveyor of sausage rolls marked the change over from
Jacko to Chris, who also decided to peg our speed at 20 miles per hour and
was stopped only, and briefly by a ford.

34 miles marked the final change-over point and lunchtime. A bizarre
'Antiques Village' called Battlesbridge - provided the backdrop for much
needed dissection of the minutiae of the day. Chris and Jacko
congratulated me for almost being run over by a car, a fly crawled into my
ear and Jacko confessed that having seen it on road signs that day, he had
come to the reaslisation that Billericay was a place in Essex and not, as
he had previously assumed, a tropical island.

It was my turn at the front. Half from stubborness - not wanting to be the
slow one - and half from wanting it all to be over, I made sure we kept up
our previous pace - hoping I would be last to break. Thankfully, the

> intervention of a fly, entering Jacko's throat

and much accompanying
choking and spluttering, brought some welcome respite as we pulled over 8
miles from Southend-on-Sea.

The final 8 miles came easily at a slightly less break-neck speed (19 mph)
and we soon found ourselves at the end of the ride. Unfortunately this was
at a station not served on Sundays, as a man on the train would helpfully
point out an hour later as we passed it on our way home.

Having calibrated my legs to endure exactly 50 miles, this extra detour was
difficult - but mercifully short. We were soon on our way back to London,
via the tropical idyll of Billericay.
