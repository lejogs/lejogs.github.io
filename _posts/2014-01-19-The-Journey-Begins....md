Chris was late. Idiot.

Not really the greatest of starts to our LEJOG adventure. We killed time drinking tea (likely to be a theme of the next 9 months) and mocking him (another likely theme). 

When he eventually arrived on a shiny new Trek we realised there was another problem - we didn't quite know how we were going to navigate the next 50 miles or so. It turns out Rich and I could probably have used the last hour a bit more effectively. Idiots.

A roll of parcel tape helped attach an iPhone to the front of Rich's bike and we were finally ready...

To be honest we looked pretty shambolic as we set off towards Crystal Palace and out to the country roads of the North Downs. But it didn't really matter. Our adventure had begun!

It was a great little route to get our training started. Enough hills to keep us working hard but not enough to put us off on the first ride. We headed past West Wickham, winding through the lovely villages of Keston and Downe, and into the woods south of Biggin Hill. I love how London just ends. One minute you're cycling up a busy main road or residential street and the next you feel as if you are miles from anywhere.

The weather helped too. Cold but with blue skies and sunshine. Pretty much perfect for mid January.  

35 miles in and Titsey Hill was quickly labelled "the worst hill in the world" (although I suspect that this honour maybe bestowed on more than one hill over the course of 2014.)  A steep climb on a main road with cars rushing past. Not a lot of fun. Luckily at the top was Tatsfield and a stop at The Old Ship for much needed food. We left the pub to find our first puncture. Unsurprisingly it was on my bike and probably served me right for going on about my new tyres. 

The run back to London in the fading light was flat and smooth. Legs and other body parts told us that we're not ready yet ... but today was a brilliant start.



We'd love it if anyone wants to come cycling with us over the next few months so if you're feeling energetic then give one of us a shout!
