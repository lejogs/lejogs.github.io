It almost didn’t start very well.


After a fantastic journey (and sleep) on the Night Riviera we arrived
in Penzance to a beautiful Cornish morning. Our support crew were
already there and greeted us on the platform with cups of tea.


We loaded the car and jumped in a taxi for the short journey to Land’s
End. It was then that Henry, jet lagged from his flight for New York,
realised he hadn’t got his helmet. It was still on the train. Luckily
the train hadn’t yet left for London so a quick jog back to the
platform rectified the situation. Not the most promising of starts.


Land’s End was deserted. This was excellent because it looked like it
wouldn’t take long for it to take on a “theme park” feel. We took our
pictures at the famous sign, filled our water bottles and, at some
time around 9:20am we were off.


It was a glorious day to start our trip. Words can’t really do it
justice so take a look at these pictures…


Our support crew (Rich’s parents) have set an incredibly high standard
for both crew work and hospitality. Brews on the platform, lunch at a
pub, pictures as we cycled past, epic lasagne and pie for tea. They
even tailed us for a few minutes at one point which made us feel like
a proper team!


Tonight we’re in Fowey and it turns out the town have organised a
firework display in our honour. Although most of the residents seem to
think that it’s part of the yearly regatta…


Tomorrow we head across Dartmoor. Today we learnt that Cornwall is
beautiful and very hilly.
