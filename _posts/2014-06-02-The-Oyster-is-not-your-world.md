This week saw us venture out to the east of London to Whitstable on
the north coast of Kent. In a bold start, reminiscent of Usain Bolt -
we scarfed down a bacon sandwich outside London Bridge station before
going 100m and coming to a stop. Jacko had had his 5th puncture - as
the running totals at the bottom of each blog can attest, we've only
had 6 overall and the other one was from our guest star, my dad.
Still, practice makes perfect and Jacko is now a tuned tire changing
machine - back up the hill to the cycle shop to use their pump and we
were ready to start. Again.

The ride out of London is normally a painful process but a well
plotted route made it an easy ride through Bromley, where London
relents and the beautiful rolling countryside begins. We found
ourselves back in the clutches of our erstwhile nemesis, Titsey Hill
(blogs passim) but thankfully going down it this time â€“ which turned
out to be almost as terrifying, if a lot less tiring.

Titsey Hill takes you onto the Pilgrims' Way, a path that runs from
Winchester to Cantebury and brought us safely to West Malling for
lunch. Over lunch, another cyclist - much as I would imagine a
weather-beaten sea-captain would in a smugglers' tavern of old -
regaled us with tales of a mighty hill that lay in our path 10 miles
thence.

10 miles later and with no hill in sight I think I may have mocked his
warning. 13 miles later and having being utterly Ahabed by a giant
hill, I realised he knew what we was talking about. The three of us
stood panting pathetically at the top of Hollingbourne Hill and Chris
commented sarcastically how utterly professional we all looked and
continued his bizarre form of personalised yoga he uses to keep the
knee-demons at bay. 28 miles to go.

The ride into Whitstable was excellent - the Garmin,
characteristically useless as ever, was held in check by Jacko - who I
think entirely for reasons of hilarity, had utterly lost his voice and
therefore gave each direction in a barely audible, doleful rasp. We
soon found ourselves on the beautiful, sunny, pebble beach you can see
at the top and tucking into a plate of delicious oysters - a very
welcome reward after a long ride. There was just enough time for Jacko
to remark that the uninterrupted horizon provides little support to
the middle-distance-starer before we headed for the train home.
