> Although I've really enjoyed the odd ride,

I've found most of the 700+ miles I've covered in training out here fairly
lonely and uninspiring. And it's not just that every ride the lads back
home have been on seems to end or incorporate a choice food or drink stop
or destination - delicious lunch at a delightful country pub here, dinner
at a top steak restaurant there. All the while, I find myself pulling up to
another strip mall in up-state New York or suburban New Jersey where the
only real choice is bagels or bagels. It's more down to the limited
camaraderie between the members of the New York Cycle Club I go on these
rides with - don't get me wrong, they're all nice people, it's just that
they're strangers for the most part.

don't all rush to the world's smallest violin and play me the world's
saddest song. Some of the rides have been great - including a ride out to
the Delaware river which included traversing the 'famous' Washington
Crossing Bridge (where Washington staged his comeback against the Brits in
1776) and criss-crossing the rolling agricultural fields of Pennsylvania,
slightly reminiscent of the Kentish countryside. It's also been a
logistically easy and good value way to "get out of the city" at the
weekend, without really going anywhere which, when combined with the garden
and rooftop of my new apartment building, has gone a long way to keeping me
sane in the New York City summer heat.

This time in two weeks, we'll be two days into the ride when I'm sure I'll
