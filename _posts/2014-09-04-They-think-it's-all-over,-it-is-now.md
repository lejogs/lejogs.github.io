> We reached the end

While a full update on our last day will be forthcoming, we wanted to let
you know that we made it to John O'Groats before we enjoy a few too many beers
and, undoubtedly, drams of whiskey. This also gives us some time to
consider our achievement and that we won't be waking up to another day in
the saddle! We have several hours on the train tomorrow as we begin to work
our way back to London and promise to provide a full debrief on today's
ride and what we can remember from this evening's celebrations.

> But before we sign off,

A massive thanks to all those who made up our support team over the two
weeks and those who donated very generously to the cause.


Henry
