##Cycling from Land’s End to John O’Groats
How hard can it be? … was the first thought that ran through my mind.

This Top Gear attitude towards stuff means that, like an idiot, I decided that cycling from Land’s End to John O’Groats would be a good idea.

I discussed this with *Chris* over a beer and a burger (obviously). Luckily he’s even more of an idiot than me and agreed that it was a brilliant idea “as long as [I can] buy a bike and a GoPro”.

**Rich** took about half a second to convince. He’s a complete idiot. Last year he cycled from London to Paris on a Brompton. Our team was now three.

And **Henry**? Well Henry lives in New York so there’s a strong chance he doesn’t even know he’s been signed up for this…

So over 12 days in late August 2014 we will be cycling the (almost) 1000 miles between the southernmost and northernmost points of mainland Britain.

Why that way round? … because everything gets better as you head north!

##Doing some good

While this didn’t start as a charity venture we really hope we can use the opportunity to raise a lot of money for a very worthy cause.

The four of us have been lucky to never hear the 'C' word. Unfortunately though, like many others, we know people close to us who have had that awful experience.

We can’t imagine what feels like to get the news that you've been diagnosed with cancer. But we do know that as a friend or family member you instantly feel both terrible and utterly useless. My best mate has been battling cancer over the last few years and all I think I've managed to do to help is show up and drink his beer!

The great news is that my mate’s habit of being good at everything has been pretty handy when it comes to beating cancer and he is doing well. However, sadly both Rich's uncle and Chris' grandad weren't so lucky.

One thing we can do to help is to try and raise a shed load of cash to support research into finding a cure ... that's where you also come in!

##Give us your money (please!)

You may think this is a jolly holiday, you may think that money's a bit tight at the moment, or you may just think we're idiots. However, while all these are true, we know you will also think that sponsoring us is totally worthwhile.

So what are you waiting for?!

Thank you.

**Jacko** and the team
